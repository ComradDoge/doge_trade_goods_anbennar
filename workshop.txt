- This is a port of goods from my Shattered mod into Anbennar. Trade goods expanded being the base of this system.
- This mod provides 50 new trade goods, new buildings and slight rebalance of existing ones.

- Anyone is free to use this mod as they see fit, just add the credits.

- I fully welcome lore help in regards to where to place goods. I have done some minor placement but generally it's not manual. 

- The goods are changed through a decision, so in theory you could add this to your existing saves and just click the decision. Making separate save is recommended though.

- As of right now, aproach this mod as somewhat unstable. Although from the very quick testing it seems fine.
